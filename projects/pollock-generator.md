For the University of Chicago's MLH Hackathon (Uncommon Hacks), my friend and I created `pollock-generator`, a Python program that stochastically generates paintings in the style of Jackson Pollock using an algorithmic approach. Our project won Best Design! We used `python`, `matplotlib`, and `numpy`.

You can find our project [here](https://github.com/ekxue/pollock)!

Here's an example of the results:
