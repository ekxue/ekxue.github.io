Hi there! Nice to meet you, I'm Emily.

Currently, I'm a Software Development Engineer at Groupon.

I graduated from the University of Chicago with a BS in Computer Science in 2020.

When I'm not hacking away in front of my laptop, you'll find me painting, enjoying art exhibits ([here's a recent favorite](https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/3931?locale=en)!), or watching my favorite comedians, like Hasan Minhaj.
